# Portfolio Introduction
Hi, I'm Dhruv Chowdhary, and this is my portfolio of projects that I have created throughout my programming journey. I started this journey by learning the basics of Java: Objects, Iteration, Arrays, and Inheritance. Using what I learned, I went on to create a [Tic Tac Toe Game](#Java). I also furthered my Java experience by taking "Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures" at the University of Minnesota where I learned about more complex structures and some basics of Python. Then, I moved on to using Swift for iOS devices. I learned how to make a basic user interface with stacks and buttons in SwiftUI and also created some games with more depth in SpriteKit.


# Java 
**Tic Tac Toe Game**

This is a Tic Tac Toe game that used 2D arrays and a JFrame with buttons to create a displayed clickable board. The game automatically switches between the "X" Player and the "O" player after each turn.

# Swift (iOS) 
**Ghost Pilots**

This is a shooting singeplayer game in progress. It required a lot of math, collisions, and particles to create smooth motion and animations. I plan on adding multiplayer functionality to this game in the future.
