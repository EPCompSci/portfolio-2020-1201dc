# iOS-Portfolio
Hi, I'm Dhruv Chowdhary, and this is my portfolio of projects that I have created in my programming journey. I started this journey by learning the basics of Java. I learned how to use Objects, Iteration, Arrays, and Inheritance. Then I moved on to coding with Swift for iOS devices. I learned how to make basic user interface with stacks and buttons in SwiftUI. I also created some games with more depth in SpriteKit.


# Java Apps
**Tic Tac Toe Game**

This game used 2D arrays and a JFrame with buttons to create a clickable board.

# iOS Apps

**APBO Game**

This is a shooting singeplayer game in progress. It required a lot of math, collisions, and particles to develop. I plan on adding multiplayer functionality to this game in the future.
